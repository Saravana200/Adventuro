# Travel Recommendation System

Our innovative travel recommendation system is a dynamic solution that integrates visual analysis and machine learning to transform the travel planning experience.

## Idea/Solution/Prototype

### Harnessing Visual Analysis
- *Ambience Selection*: Users can manually select the ambience by using the sample sceneries shown on the homepage.
- *Image Analysis*: Users have the option to upload a photo, which will be analyzed by the state-of-the-art image captioning model, BLIP (Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training for Unified Vision-Language Understanding and Generation). BLIP returns tags such as “forest with waterfall”, “island resort”, “amusement parks”, etc.
- *Location Discovery*: Utilizing Google's database and a Reverse Search Engine, we will display the exact location of the image with new, updated images.
- *Personalized Place Recommendations*: Recommend places within the user-selected radius based on the selected sample sceneries or the uploaded photo, using an RBM model and highly scalable, distributed collaborative filtering techniques for hotels, places, and restaurants.
